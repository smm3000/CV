I am a motivated full-stack developer and recent graduate of Makers Academy. Before embarking on my career as a software developer I worked in finance and started my career at a big4 firm.

Whilst working at a large tech firm I was lucky enough to work with Tech/Product teams which sparked my interest in software development. I am passionate about learning different technologies and improving my skills as a developer. 

I am looking forward to sharing my skills and working as part of a team on interesting problems. 

Please find a copy of my CV here.
