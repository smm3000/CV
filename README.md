## Skills

 **Team Player**

* Worked in a number of diverse teams across different projects throughout my career - I enjoy joining and working alongside different teams. In both of my previous roles I have also been lucky enough to lead on projects/teams and worked on large cross-functional teams. During my time at Makers, I was lucky enough to work on a number of projects with different teams.

**Attention to detail**

* Throughout my previous career roles - attention to detail has been an important skill which I have been able to develop throughout my career. This is in part due to the compliance and technical nature of working in high-pressure finance teams. This skill was equally important during my time at Makers and has helped whilst I have been learning software development. 

**Enjoy Learning**

* I thrive on learning new things & understanding how things work. During my time at KPMG I had to take external professional qualification exams and have experience in learning new things. Whilst at Makers I've really enjoyed learning new technologies and tools, during my final project at Makers - I was able to begin learning a new tech stack which was an exciting experience.

**Analytical Mindset**

* Throughout my previous roles, I have been able to develop the ability to analyse and solve a variety of problems. I have been fortunate to be able to apply this mindest and problem solving skills across a number of different sized clients across a range of sectors. During my time at Makers - solving problems and analysing issues really helped my software development skills. I thrive and enjoy roles where I can analyse problems and come up with solutions.
